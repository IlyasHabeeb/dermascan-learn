# Classification of Skin Moles using Inception model

This repository contains the scripts that were used to initialize, re-train and predict using Google's Inception model for Image Classification.

`retrained_graph.pb` is the final graph that was obtained after re-training the model on dataset of skin moles. `label_image.py` can be used to predict the label for a given image which uses `retrained_graph.pb` model for prediction.
